# Branching Strategy

Our branching strategy is simple: We only branch to the master branch when we
are handing in an iteration for COMP 3350; considering that every button or 
feature added either fully works or indicates that it will be implemented in the
future, and that the code compiles and runs with no errors. Anytime we make 
changes to our code that is relevant to a branch that was already created, we 
just make the changes in Android Studio and push the changes to that branch 
afterwards. Otherwise, we create a new branch with specific differences and the
commit message displays what was updated for future reference.

However, any written/markdown files, as well as in-line comments, will be pushed
to the master branch since it will not create any major problems against the project.

As observed from the graph, most master branch changes are for .md files, and
there are only seen merges from a branch to the master branch only when we are
handing in an iteration.
