                                <p>"Working on this project, helped me realize and appreciate the importance of working in a team. It was amazing to learn how important it is to document along with gaining skills like distributing the code into a proper under-layer architecture, following Design principles, and Test-driven environment. Alongside this, 
                                    learning GitLab and Android studios was something that I definitely believe would be useful for the future."</p>

                                <p>After handing in Iteration 2, our team reflected on the things we did right, and things that we did wrong. We communicated regularly throughout each iteration which was one of the assets of our team. This made our beginning phase, that is, iteration 0 very well discussed and systematic. But in the consecutive iterations, we believe our team got a little overwhelmed with learning GitLab, Android Studio, and other things while maintaining the 
                                    organizational aspect of the project, that is, documentation and regular discussions using the GitLab itself.</p>

                        <li data-scroll-reveal="enter right move 30px over 0.6s after 0.5s">
                            <div class="text">
                                <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">----------------------</h4>
                                <p>In Iteration 1's retrospective, our main problem was not utilizing GitLab’s organizational features to their full potential, so we decided to utilize GitLab even further for Iteration 2. While we did that in Iteration 2 and we were organized in terms of who is doing what task, we still did not close down issues in time as we were going back-and-forth on Discord; which was great in terms of effective communication in the given instance but not quite effective closer to the few days before the release. So, while we were focused on task organization, we ended up losing track of time organization and load management. Also, we reflected that our 
                                    division of tasks by architecture classifications did not exactly work as planned. Basically, one of us handled persistence classes, one handled objects and logic classes, one handled user interface, and one handled documentation and testing. This proved to be harder than anticipated since they all correlate and relate, which in turn ended up not making a feature work when one of the classes did not work.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <h2>What would we do differently if we had the chance to start over?</h2>
                        <li data-scroll-reveal="enter right move 30px over 0.6s after 0.6s">
                            <div class="text">
                                <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">----------------------</h4>
                                <p>Therefore, we all agreed that for Iteration 3, we should close every task that we finish, divide the tasks into even smaller tasks and assign every task between us, four developers, while focusing on one feature at a time and fully implementing it. In addition,
                                    this time we also considered fixing bugs from the previous iteration and additional documentation tasks required for this iteration as a separate set of tasks so that each task can be given equal value and consideration explicitly. This resulted in better overall management of tasks as compared to previous iterations.

                                    Thus, if we had a chance to start over differently, we would try to minimize the little procrastination that we did this time & try our best to utilize GitLab to its full potential for organizing. We all also considered this as a good wake-up call to realize that we are a little disorganized as students and could have reflected on that little earlier.</p>

                                    The image on the right is a graph showing our project's velocity of Iteration 1, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3 (commits are based on developer tasks and user stories):
                                    
                                    It is evident that in Iteration 1, we did not utilize GitLab that well, but we did better in Iteration 2. In further investigation, it is evident that we closed most of the tasks on the same day of the Iteration 2 due date. It can also be noticed that in iteration 2 and 3, we mostly achieved what we expected, which means our estimations got much better. This was mostly due to reflecting the best of our capabilities on what we had after iteration 1. Also, Iteration 1 was a little overwhelming for all of us since that was a time when we all were trying to learn new environments while maintaining the documentation about the project so we were not able to manage all the workload properly. But we learned and performed accordingly in the next 2 iterations. Also, since, iteration 3 was our last submission we mostly tried to wrap up our project as much as we can and by this time since it was almost 3 months of us working together we tried our best to utilize each team member’s strengths to best of our capabilities.
